# basic-pygame
This repo contains the code for a basic game in Python using the pygame library.

The player can move left and right, and jump with the UP arrow. An enemy character spawns and moves back and forth along a defined path.
Collisions are -5 points, shooting the enemy gives +1 points.

After the enemy is killed, a new one spawns a few seconds later on a different path.

Notes:
Make sure all the files are in the same directory.
Check the bitrate of your SFX files to make sure that the pygame library can recognize them.
